                    If I receive a faulty/damaged packaged product from bookswagon, what should I do in that case?

                    if there is anything found improper with the products provided by books-wagons, we will for sure resolve every issue.

                    If any product shipped to you is in faulty/damaged condition, you are asked by us to e-mail the images of the faulty/damaged packet,
                    as soon as you open the packet at “email id”. We will replace the faulty/damaged product by mailing us back the default packet.
                    As soon as we will receive the product, we will instantly send you the replacement order and we will also cover up for the costs
                    incurred in mailing us back the order. If by any chance the product is out of stock, we will at once refund the amount to the customer.
